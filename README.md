An online book selling website.

A complete website consisting of 3 dynamic pages.

Home page has variety of books available from multiple categories.

All books are shown on a card like structure where Book's Name, Photo, Price, Ratings and Reviews are shown. There is also Buy now button for each book that refers you to Book details page.

It has a login/signup page that is dynamic which changes forms for login and signup.

There is also a book details page that shows the information about the book that you click on. It uses JS concept where the chosen book's details are fetched and encoded in the referal page's URL. After arriving on Book details page the encoded data from URL is extracted and displayed.

This whole website project is totally my idea, it is not copied or inspired from any other project.
